<!-- 1.there are 3 ways to crteate a vairable there are let,const,var....
2.let and const are almost same but only thing different is we can't
  the the value of avirable which is already assigned.
3.there are some issues in var and it is same as let..so that's why 
  we r not using var in new js code  -->
