<!-- 
    1.  In python if we try to print imndices of elemenrt for which
        it has more than the length of arr such a=[1,2,3] & if we
        try to print a[3] it will throw an issue called list index
        out of range but in js it will give` undefind.
    2.  In JavaScript, when you declare an array using const, 
        it means the reference to the array is constant, not the 
        content of the array itself. This means you can still 
        modify the elements of the array, such as changing 
        their values or adding/removing elements.
    3.  Array.isArray() will check if that is array or not since
        array is an obj this will be helpful in further.
    4.  splice(x,y)  | x-> index number and y-> is the no of numbers
        that we want to remove from x
